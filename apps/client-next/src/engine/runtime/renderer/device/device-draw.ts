device-draw.ts - the geometry draw handle

The handle geometry.ts gives every consumer: read-only outside, updated in
place by the geometry owner. Kept apart from that owner so the handle's
shape (one class, monomorphic count reads) is the whole of this file.

DeviceDraw

A draw handle. Consumers only read it: assigning a count throws. Its
counts, binding and capacity change in place, through select and rebind,
which only the geometry owner calls. Every handle is one class, one shape, so the
per-frame reads of its counts are monomorphic.
